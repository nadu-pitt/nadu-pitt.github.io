title: Prospective Students
---

I am actively looking for students who have strong interests and background in working at the intersections of Human-centered Systems (human factors/human-computer interaction), Smart City Technologies (human aspects in addition to the technical aspects), and Data Analytics. 

<!-- My research goal is to improve human performance, safety, and well-being by applying human factors and machine learning to the design, analysis, and evaluation of cyber-physical systems. My current research interest includes human-computer interaction/human factors, computational modeling of human behaviors, and human-centered design. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating/pursuing a Ph.D. in HF/HCI + Smart city technologies. -->

## Prospective Ph.D. Students
<p></p>

I have several Ph.D. positions in the Department of Informatics and Networked Systems, School of Computing and Information, at the University of Pittsburgh starting **Spring 2022 or Fall 2022**. Ph.D. students are typically fully funded with full tuition, health insurance, and a generous stipend. You may learn more about the program [\[here\]](https://www.dins.pitt.edu/academics/phd-information-science). If you are interested in working with me, I encourage you to apply to the IS PhD program and mention me in your statement.

Strong and self-motivated candidates with ANY of the following qualifications would be particularly encouraged to apply: (1) prior experience in studying human factors/human-computer interaction; (2) knowledge in applied data science and machine learning; (3) skills in programming and developing AR/VR/simulator applications; (4) interdisciplinary research backgrounds (design, engineering, psychology, etc.).

<!-- Strong candidates should be self-motivated and passionate about research on human-centered systems and have strong data analytical and programming skills. -->
<!-- psychology and engineering disciplines (Industrial Engineering / Electrical Engineering & Computer Science / Mechanical Engineering / Civil Engineering / etc.) -->

Interested individuals may contact me via email with the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) representative publications or writing samples if available. The subject of the email should start with “Prospective PhD Student”. I will reach out if your background seems like a potential good fit.

## Undergraduate/Master Students
<p></p>

I am excited to work with undergraduate and master students at Pitt who are interested in my research. Projects are always available for students with backgrounds or interests in human factors/human-computer interaction, intelligent transportation systems, applied data science and machine learning, or UX research/design. Funding is possible but not guaranteed. A general rule for undergraduate/master students: we do not offer research assistantships to students unless they have spent a semester working with us on a research project.

Interested individuals may contact me via email with the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests. The subject of the email should start with “Prospective Undergraduate/Master Student at Pitt”. We can then set up a meeting and discuss potential projects.

<!-- Many undergraduate researchers who worked with me became co-authors on my papers, and many of them are now at graduate schools and industry companies.  -->

## Visiting Students and Scholars
<p></p>

I might be able to host visiting students (undergraduate or graduate) and scholars depending on research interests and funding situations.

Interested individuals may contact me via email with the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts (if student); (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) representative publications or writing samples if available. The subject of the email should start with “Prospective Visiting Students/Scholars”.
