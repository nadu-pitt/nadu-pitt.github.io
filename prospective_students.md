title: Prospective Students
---

I am actively looking for students who have strong interests and background in working at the intersections of Human-centered Systems (human factors/human-computer interaction), Smart City Technologies (human aspects in addition to the technical aspects), and Data Analytics. 

<!-- My research goal is to improve human performance, safety, and well-being by applying human factors and machine learning to the design, analysis, and evaluation of cyber-physical systems. My current research interest includes human-computer interaction/human factors, computational modeling of human behaviors, and human-centered design. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaborating/pursuing a Ph.D. in HF/HCI + Smart city technologies. -->

## Prospective Ph.D. Students
<p></p>

I have several fully-funded Ph.D. positions in the Department of Informatics and Networked Systems, School of Computing and Information, at the University of Pittsburgh starting **Spring 2022 or Fall 2022**. 

Strong and self-motivated candidates with ANY of the following qualifications would be particularly encouraged to apply: (1) prior experience in studying human factors/human-computer interaction; (2) knowledge in applied data science and machine learning; (3) skills in programming and developing AR/VR/simulator applications; (4) interdisciplinary research backgrounds (design, engineering, psychology, etc.).

<!-- Strong candidates should be self-motivated and passionate about research on human-centered systems and have strong data analytical and programming skills. -->
<!-- psychology and engineering disciplines (Industrial Engineering / Electrical Engineering & Computer Science / Mechanical Engineering / Civil Engineering / etc.) -->

If you are interested in working with me, I encourage you to apply to the [IS PhD program](https://www.dins.pitt.edu/academics/phd-information-science) and mention me in your statement. Feel free to contact me via email with the title “Prospective PhD Student" and include the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) representative publications or writing samples if available. However, I apologize that I may not be able to reply to the emails and provide feedback.

## Undergraduate/Master Students
<p></p>

I am excited to work with undergraduate and master students at Pitt who are interested in my research. Projects are always available for students with backgrounds or interests in any of the following areas: human factors/human-computer interaction, intelligent transportation systems, applied data science and machine learning, or UX research/design. Funding is possible but not guaranteed. A general rule for undergraduate/master students: we do not offer research assistantships to students unless they have spent a semester working with us on a research project.

If you are interested in working with me, feel free to contact me via email with the title “Prospective Undergraduate/Master Student at Pitt” and include the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests. I will reach out if there is a potential fit and we can then set up a meeting for discussion.

<!-- Many undergraduate researchers who worked with me became co-authors on my papers, and many of them are now at graduate schools and industry companies.  -->

## Visiting Students and Scholars
<p></p>

I might be able to host visiting students (undergraduate or graduate) and scholars depending on research interests and funding situations.

Interested individuals may contact me via email with the title “Prospective Visiting Students/Scholars” and include the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts (if student); (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) representative publications or writing samples if available.
<!-- I will reach out if your background seems like a potential good fit. -->
