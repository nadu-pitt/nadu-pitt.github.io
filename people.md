The Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) Lab aims to improve human performance, safety, and well-being in intelligent systems, with applications ranging from transportation, healthcare, to military domains. By applying both data-driven and theory-driven methods, the work (1) analyzes how humans interact with technologies; (2) develops computational models to simulate and predict human behaviors; and (3) proposes and evaluates design ideas to enable effective and safe collaborations between humans and intelligent agents. See more information on [Research](./research).
