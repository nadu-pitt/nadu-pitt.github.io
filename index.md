I’m an Assistant Professor in the Department of Informatics and Networked Systems, School of Computing and Information, at the University of Pittsburgh. I received my Ph.D. in Industrial & Operations Engineering from University of Michigan, working with Jessie Yang. I also received a Graduate Certificate in Data Science at Michigan Institute for Data Science. Prior to Ph.D., I received my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from Zhejiang University. My research interests include human factors in smart city domains, human-centered computing, and user experience design. **I am looking for Ph.D. students and undergraduate/master researchers!**
