I received my Ph.D. in  Industrial & Operations Engineering from [University of Michigan](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/). I also received a Graduate Certificate in Data Science at [Michigan Institute for Data Science](https://midas.umich.edu/). My research interests include human factors in smart city domains, human-centered computing, and user experience design. I am actively looking for Ph.D. students and undergraduate/master researchers!
